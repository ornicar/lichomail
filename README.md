Cool and fresh signup email for lichess.org

Today I want to introduce new template for [lichess.org](http://lichess.org) registration email.

## Why it's better?

* It is better at least because it's not a plain text but a simple but beautiful template.
* It is done in minimalistic design.
* It works on most of devices and works correctly with different email services.

## Where to see it?

You can follow this link and see the [demo](http://alexbagirov.github.io/lichomail).

## Screenshot
Here is a screen for you how should it look like on both laptop and mobile phone:
